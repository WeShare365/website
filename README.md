# My First Year Apprentice Project 🚀

Hello there! 👋 My name is David and this website represents a significant milestone in my journey. Developed during my first year as an apprentice, I dedicated 10 days spread over 10 weeks to bring this project to life. The experience was both challenging and rewarding, and I'm excited to share it with you!

## 📖 Story Behind the Project

This website is a testament to the skills I've acquired and the passion I've developed during my first year as an apprentice. Each line of code, each design decision, reflects my growth and dedication. I hope you find it as intriguing to explore as it was for me to develop.

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

If you're curious about the design direction for this project, take a look at our [Figma Design Blueprint](https://www.figma.com/file/Qb0nCv7Nd5POtWhVF2e8pt/WeShare?type=design&node-id=14-4&mode=design). It lays out the visual roadmap I aimed for during the project's development.

## 📥 Getting Started

### Hosting Locally with XAMPP

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   First, navigate to your `htdocs` directory. Then clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WeShare365/website.git
   ```

2. **Setting Up the Database**

   You'll need to set up an SQL database for this project. Once you've created a database, proceed to import the SQL schema. Navigate to the `/project-main/sql_database.sql` file in the repository and paste the code into your SQL management platform to structure your database.

### 🌐 Deploying to the Web

Make sure you have your server and SQL services running through XAMPP. Once set up, simply navigate to the project through your local web server, and you're good to go!
